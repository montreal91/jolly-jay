My code for
[Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)
tutorials.
Currently I'm working through the tutorials.

* **python** folder contains an interpreter written with python by tutorials.
* **kotlin** folder contains an interpreter written with kotlin as an exercise.
